# manuscrit-digit-recognition
real time digit recognition using Keras/SVC and pygame
with this project we can predict output corresponding to handwritten images using the interface Pygame.
the SVC(support vector classifier) and sequential model of Keras are used  for creating this predictive model.
 I trained SVC for 8X8 MNIST dataset, but the accuracy of this model is not good when I run this model on my handwritten images(600X600). It is due to resizing images from 600X600 to 8X8.
